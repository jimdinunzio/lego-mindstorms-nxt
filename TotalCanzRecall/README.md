# TotalCanzRecall
This project is a program written in the commercially available ROBOTC environment for the LEGO Mindstorms NXT.  Its purpose is to command a robot to perform the required actions to succeed in a contest called "Clean The Room" hosted by the Robot Club of Southern California (https://www.rssc.org/cleantheroom.html). 
In a nutshell the robot is to detect soda cans in a square area on the floor outlined by black tape, capture them and bring them back to an area the size of a sheet of 8" 1/2 x 11" paper and do this completely autonomously.
Included here are instructions on how to build the robot, the 3D Lego Lego Digital Design model with some rendered pictures and all the source code files to make it work.  There are also videos on youtube located in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmb0WjGtyZZS9qjUYhY4bdeh4ZQYx7BYS.
The robot design was derived from a video of Jorge McGomes NXT Can Grabber shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5bzBuwgB0&t=0s&list=FLwVtKMkv51A4G7efLuwZzxQ&index=6
and augmented to meet the contest needs.  I could not find any instructions for building his robot or source code.
A great source for writing the localization routines I used was this article from Nick McCrea, a freelance software engineer, "An Introductory Robot Programming Tutorial", https://www.toptal.com/robotics/programming-a-robot-an-introductory-tutorial.  And another was this NXT lesson from U of Aarhus in Denmark, http://legolab.cs.au.dk/DigitalControl.dir/NXT/Lesson10.dir/Lesson.html
I used Lego Digital Designer software (https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd/download) to build the model in 3D and Blueprint (http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=108346) to create the instruction manual.
This project took 2-3 months of spare time to the first offical release in Jan, 2019. It achieved second place in the contest at RSSC.  The winner was a robot that picked up the can and dropped it in a wastebasket.
I hope this project is useful to anyone wishing to learn about odometry, dead reckoning, building LEGO robots, and using software with multiple tasks to perform a autonomously.

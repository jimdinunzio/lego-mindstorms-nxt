# TotalCanzRecall
This project is a program written in the commercially available ROBOTC environment for the LEGO Mindstorms NXT.  Its purpose is to command a robot to perform the required actions to succeed in a contest called [*Clean The Room*]((https://www.rssc.org/cleantheroom.html) hosted by the [Robotics Society of Southern California](www.rssc.org). 

In a nutshell the robot is to detect soda cans in a square area on the floor outlined by black tape, capture them one at a time and bring them back to an area the size of a sheet of 8" 1/2 x 11" paper outlined by black tap and do this completely autonomously.

Included here are instructions on how to build the robot, the 3D Lego Digital Designer model (and a more accurate [Studio](https://studio.bricklink.com/v2/build/studio.page) model) with some
 rendered pictures and all the source code files to make it work.  There are also videos on youtube of the robot doing trial runs located in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmb0WjGtyZZS9qjUYhY4bdeh4ZQYx7BYS).
 
The robot design was derived from a video of Jorge McGomes NXT Can Grabber shown [here](

and augmented to meet the contest needs.  I could not find any instructions for building his robot or source code, but I wanted to learn how to do it myself anyway.
A great source for writing the localization routines I used was this article from Nick McCrea, a freelance software engineer, [*An Introductory Robot Programming Tutorial*](https://www.toptal.com/robotics/programming-a-robot-an-introductory-tutorial).  And another was this [NXT lesson from U of Aarhus in Denmark](http://legolab.cs.au.dk/DigitalControl.dir/NXT/Lesson10.dir/Lesson.html)

I used [Lego Digital Designer software](https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd/download) to build the model in 3D and [Blueprint](http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=108346) to create the instruction manual.
This project took 2-3 months of spare time to the first offical release in Jan, 2019. It achieved second place in the contest at RSSC in 2018.  The winner was a robot that picked up the can and dropped it in a wastebasket.

I hope this project is useful to anyone wishing to learn about odometry, dead reckoning, building LEGO robots, and using software with multiple tasks to perform an autonomous task.  

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, bug reports, and if you built it and tried it out.

Thanks,
